The Yet Another Sermon Host Shortcode plugin provides a convenient way for WordPress users to embed sermons from Yet Another Sermon Host. It adds a settings page under the WordPress Settings tab where users can enter their Yet Another Sermon Host username and generate shortcodes to display the latest sermon or a page of sermons on their website.

== Description ==
The Yet Another Sermon Host Shortcode plugin is a powerful tool for WordPress users who want to integrate their sermons from Yet Another Sermon Host into their websites. It offers a comprehensive solution by creating a dedicated settings page under the WordPress dashboard\'s Settings tab.

On the settings page, users can easily enter their Yet Another Sermon Host username, which serves as the foundation for generating shortcodes. Two key shortcodes are provided: [sermon-latest] and [sermon-page]. The [sermon-latest] shortcode enables users to display the latest sermon, dynamically fetching the sermon content based on the specified user\'s account. The [sermon-page] shortcode, on the other hand, allows users to create a dedicated page displaying multiple sermons, providing visitors with easy access to a collection of valuable content.

The plugin employs a user-friendly interface, simplifying the process of embedding sermons within WordPress pages or posts. It also includes a convenient \"click-to-copy\" feature, enabling users to effortlessly copy the generated shortcodes to their clipboard with a single click. This saves time and eliminates the need for manual shortcode input.

To ensure seamless functionality, the plugin intelligently handles dependencies, enqueuing the required JavaScript library, Clipboard.js, for smooth copy-to-clipboard functionality. Additionally, it employs a separate stylesheet, style.css, to maintain consistent and visually appealing rendering of the shortcode fields.

With the Yet Another Sermon Host Shortcode plugin, WordPress users can effortlessly integrate their sermons, enhancing their website\'s functionality and providing their audience with easy access to valuable religious content. This plugin offers a powerful, intuitive, and streamlined solution for leveraging the features of Yet Another Sermon Host within the WordPress ecosystem.
